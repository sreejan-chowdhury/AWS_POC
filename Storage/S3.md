## Buckets
 - Stores Objects containing data and metadata, can be configured and created in any specific region.
 - On addition of an object to bucket, AWS creates a unique version ID and assigns it to the object.
 - By default, 100 buckets can be created in each AWS account.
 - Unlimited storage.

## Object
 - Entities stored in S3.
 - Consists of data, a key and metadata
 - Metadata : Name, FOrmat and the time at which the file was added.
 - Object can be uniquely identified within a bucket using key(name) and version ID.
 - Each Object can be upto 5TB.

## S3 Storage Classes : Can be configured at Object level
  1. S3 Standard : High availability , durability and Performance. For Frequently accessed data. This is by Default.
  2. Intelligent Tiering : Optimise cost by automatically moving object to most cost effective tier. Stores object in two access tiers.
                            One is storing in cost tier for frequent access. Another is optimised for infrequent access.
  3. Standard IA : `Standard Infrequent Access`. low per gb storage and low per gb retrieval fee. Usually stored in min of 3 AZ.
  4. One Zone IA : Same as Standard IA but stored in single zone. cost 20% less than Standard IA.
                      Use when same level of Availability and Resilience as Standard, Standard IA is not required.  It is not fault tolerant.
                      e.g Secondary Data Backup.
  5. Glacier : Low cost data for archiving data. 3 retrival options : from minutes to hrs. 


## Version
 - Allows us to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.
 - New version with every upload.
 - Versioning has to be enabled. Once enabled it can't be disabled. It has to be suspended.
 - If File is deleted, it can be restored again : https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-undelete-configuration/

## Cross Region Replication
 - Source Bucket and Destination Bucket are in different regions.
 - As soon as data is added in source, it is replicated to destination.
 - Limitations : 
    1. Can't replicate Lifecycle events.
    2. Bucket owners need permission to replicate objects.
    3. It is unidirectional, if we delete a source file it will not be replicated at destination.
    4. If bucket has objects before versioning, those won't be replciated.

## S3 Transfer Acceleration
 - Pricing is added in addition to the data trasfer pricing.
 - Speeds up the data transfer.

## Lifecycle Policy
 - For moving data from one type to another. e.g from Standard to Glacier based on last accessed date.

#### TO UPLOAD HUGE FILES

1. Multipart Upload
2. Snow Ball : 50 TB ot 80 TB boxes
3. Snow Cone : 8TB
4. Snow Mobile : 10 PB truck

## Demo

### Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3
  - Goto AWS S3 service. `Create Bucket`. Bucket name should be unique.
	- De-select `Block public access` 
	- Create the bucket.
	- Once created, select the bucket and goto `properties` , and select `Static website hosting`.
	- Enable `Use this bucket to host a website` and index document as `index.html` .
	- Create an index.html page and upload to bucket.
  - Select `index.html` form Objects tab. Goto `Permission` . Edit ACL to allow `Read` for public access.
  - Access the bucket or index.html. e.g https://s3.amazonaws.com/sreejan.staticwebpagetest1/index.html

### Replication
  - Create 2 Buckets in 2 different Regions.
  - Go to the source bucket. Select `Management`. `Create Replciation Rule`.
  - Select the Source and Destination.
  - Select a suitable IAM role.
  - Save.
  - Upload a file in source bucket. It will be replicated.

### Transfer and Retrieve Data from Glacier Through Lifecycle Policy
  - Select the Bucket to apply it to. Goto : `Mangement` and Add Lifecycle Rule. 
  - Goto Glacier to retrieve the data.
